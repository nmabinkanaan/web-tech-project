 ## Tweety Bird and Sylvester game

In this project, we proposed Tweety Bird and Sylvester game which was inspired by the famous chrome dinosaur game. This game was originally intended to eliminate user boredom associated with the sudden internet outage. 

 As for the Tweety Bird and Sylvester game, it is a game that we programmed and published on a local server. All players of all ages can play, it is an easy game without any complications. The game, in a simple way, follows this arrangement. At first, the player registers in the game, after registration, it moves to the main game page. The element (Tweety) tries to pass all the obstacle (Sylvester) that try to catch it. When it hits an obstacle(Sylvester), it loses this round of the game.While the player playing the round a number of game score appears on the screen that shows the distance and point has reached. Also, the page reviews the highest score obtained by other players registered in the game. The game targets all sane people of all categories. It is a popular game and there are many copies of it in various forms.
